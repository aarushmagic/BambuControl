# BambuControl
BambuControl is a Google Apps Script–based access-control system for Bambu Lab 3D printers. It monitors logged 3D print jobs and classifies them as originating from authorized or unauthorized users based on submitted print logs.

## Problem Statement
A university organization operates two Bambu X1C 3D printers for student use. Students are required to complete and pass an online training before using the printers. However, because the printers are located in an open, shared space, preventing unauthorized use is difficult.

BambuControl addresses this challenge by providing a lightweight, software-based authorization check tied to print logging.

### Underlying Issues Adding Complexity
1. Internet connectivity is required so staff can remotely access and monitor the printers.
2. Network limitations: The printers must be connected to a password-protected Wi-Fi network (e.g., WPA2-PSK) rather than the campus WPA2-Enterprise network (Eduroam), preventing direct WLAN-based user authentication.
3. Limited user data: Print logs can only include a student’s name and institute email address. Additional identifying information (e.g., ID numbers or passwords) cannot be collected. 

## Basic Structure
Before starting a print, users must submit a Google Form containing:
* First name
* Last name
* Printer name
* Estimated print duration
* File name

Each submission is stored as a row in a Google Sheet, which serves as the system’s log database.

### Logs Structure
The print logs are stored in a sheet titled “Logs”, with the following structure:

| Timestamp | First Name  | Last Name  | Institute Email | Printer Name | Start Date                          | Start Time                              | Print Duration    | Expected End Time    | File Name    | Status | Email Sent |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------|--------|------------|
| Autogenerated |  From Form  |  From Form | *Custom Function\** |   From Form  | `=DATE(YEAR(A2), MONTH(A2), DAY(A2))` | `=TIME(HOUR(A2), MINUTE(A2), SECOND(A2))` |     From Form     |        `=G2+H2`        |   From Form  |  `BLANK` |    `BLANK`   |

\*Custom function(s) can be found in the relevant version(s).

### Authorized Peoples List
Authorized users are maintained in a separate sheet titled “Authorized Users”. This list is managed manually by organization staff based on successful student training completions:
|     LAST NAME    |    FIRST NAME    |       EMAIL      |
|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| Manually Entered | Manually Entered | Manually Entered |

## Solution
BambuControl automates the validation of print submissions against the authorized users list and flags unauthorized usage for staff review.
